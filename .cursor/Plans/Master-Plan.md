# Master-Plan — CatRunner

## Next hand off (cut & paste) — Lane A

P001 C1–C12 complete. To finish: (1) Run full test suite and confirm baseline. (2) Commit and push to GitHub per commit checkpoint: stage relevant files, commit with message including plan ID and description (e.g. `P001 C12: Agent updates, SPECIFICATION.md`), push to origin/main. (3) Update Master-Plan matrix row with push date and refresh next hand off. Invoke [Agents/planner.md](Agents/planner.md) after push to refresh next hand off.

## Next hand off (cut & paste) — Lane B

No further Lane B (config/assets-only) task in current scope. C9 config/assets and P001-Assets sprite art are done; example variant added at `config/variants/easy.json`. When new config- or assets-only work is added to the plan, invoke [Agents/planner.md](Agents/planner.md) to assign the next Lane B task. Lane B may edit `config/` and `assets/` only; no `ios/` or `src/` changes.

---

## Concurrent agents (max 2)

- **Lane A** edits `ios/` only. **Lane B** edits `config/` and `assets/` only (and may invoke ui-designer for asset images). No file overlap; both may run in parallel.
- When both lanes touch the same area (e.g. C3 and C7 both touch Engine), run sequentially.
- **Asset path and image spec:** Only [sprites-ui-assets.plan.md](.cursor/Plans/subplans/P001/sprites-ui-assets.plan.md) defines the asset inventory and `assets.json` path map; C2 creates the file, C9/admin consume it.
