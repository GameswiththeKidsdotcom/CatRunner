# Master-Plan — CatRunner

## Next hand off (cut & paste) — Lane A

Use the builder subagent to implement C6 (Power-up spawner — max 1, free lane only). Plan file: [.cursor/Plans/subplans/P001/C6-powerup-spawner.plan.md](.cursor/Plans/subplans/P001/C6-powerup-spawner.plan.md). Spawn power-ups per config (max active, probability, placement rule freeLaneOnly). After completion, update this hand off to C7.

## Second hand off (cut & paste) — Lane B

Use C9 (Admin panel scaffold). Plan file: [.cursor/Plans/subplans/P001/C9-admin-panel.plan.md](.cursor/Plans/subplans/P001/C9-admin-panel.plan.md) (or P001 chunk C9). Lane B may edit `config/` and `assets/` only; no `ios/` changes. Sprites & UI assets Lane B work is done: `config/default/assets.json` and asset directories are in place; see [sprites-ui-assets.plan.md](.cursor/Plans/subplans/P001/sprites-ui-assets.plan.md).

---

## Concurrent agents (max 2)

- **Lane A** edits `ios/` only. **Lane B** edits `config/` and `assets/` only (and may invoke ui-designer for asset images). No file overlap; both may run in parallel.
- When both lanes touch the same area (e.g. C3 and C7 both touch Engine), run sequentially.
- **Asset path and image spec:** Only [sprites-ui-assets.plan.md](.cursor/Plans/subplans/P001/sprites-ui-assets.plan.md) defines the asset inventory and `assets.json` path map; C2 creates the file, C9/admin consume it.
